Liri Bot

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Technologies and libraries include - Spotify, Bands In Town, and OMDB APIs, moment, javascript, json, node, an ignore file, and use of local environments for security.

Available commands users can enter:
1) concert-this
